# Planning

We using [Waffle.io](Waffle.io), that allow us to integrate with Github Issues automatically.
The Task management I follow project [Agile Methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). We have main board that contains multiple columns. ([Get start with Waffle](https://help.waffle.io/getting-started/getting-started-guide-creating-and-using-waffle-boards))

## Index

"New issues added in GitHub or Waffle are automatically added to the Inbox column. This is a great place for new requests, ideas, and bugs." -- [Waffle's definition](https://help.waffle.io/getting-started/getting-started-guide-creating-and-using-waffle-boards)

So it mean any issue that open without specify column, with appear here.

## Backlog

"A place to keep issues that are good ideas but are being saved for later." -- [Waffle's definition](https://help.waffle.io/getting-started/getting-started-guide-creating-and-using-waffle-boards)

We use this column for prioritize and plan the work to be done (Include every [Must have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method and [Should have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method method).

## In progress

"Issues that are, well, in progress. Normally used for active development. Some teams create additional columns for design, testing, etc." -- [Waffle's definition](https://help.waffle.io/getting-started/getting-started-guide-creating-and-using-waffle-boards)

This is a in progress column, which any card on the columns is on [Work In Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process) status

## Review

"Issues that have an open Pull Request that are being reviewed by other team member(s) to get feedback." -- [Waffle's definition](https://help.waffle.io/getting-started/getting-started-guide-creating-and-using-waffle-boards)

This is only for a contributor, before the pull request will accepted I (or my team) need to review issue on this column first.

## Done

"Issues that are done and shipped. Depending on your team, this may also include finishing documentation, marketing, etc." -- [Waffle's definition](https://help.waffle.io/getting-started/getting-started-guide-creating-and-using-waffle-boards)
